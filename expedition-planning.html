  <h1>Small Boat Global Coastal Expedition Planning Guide</h1>

  <p>
    This guide outlines the operational framework behind the Blue Rim 5™ Global Sailing Expedition — a disciplined small-boat coastal expedition model supported by guardian vessels and built for real-world seamanship.
  </p>

  <h2>The Small Expedition Vessel Model</h2>
  <p>
    Blue Rim 5™ operates with small expedition sailboats, typically shallow-draft vessels drawing around 4' or so. These boats offer access, efficiency, and tactical flexibility that larger yachts cannot always provide.
  </p>
  <p>
    Small vessels reward preparation and seamanship. They demand judgment, weather awareness, and disciplined routing — which is precisely the expedition model being applied.
  </p>

  <h2>Shallow Draft Strategy</h2>
  <p>
    A vessel drawing around 4' or so gains access to coastal shoals, river mouths, estuaries, and protected anchorages unavailable to deeper-draft cruisers. Draft determines access, and access determines exploration capability.
  </p>
  <p>
    Historically, shallow-draft vessels succeeded because they were adaptable, not oversized. The same principle guides modern expedition planning.
  </p>

  <h2>Guardian Vessel Formation</h2>
  <p>
    Small boats operate independently but are supported by larger guardian vessels — both sailing and power — when conditions or logistics warrant. Guardian vessels provide redundancy, weather intelligence, and coordinated response capability.
  </p>
  <p>
    This layered formation model increases safety without sacrificing small-boat access and agility.
  </p>

  <h2>Coastal & Island-Hopping Framework</h2>
  <p>
    The expedition model prioritizes coastal progression, island-to-island routing, and controlled daily mileage. This reduces exposure windows while increasing landfall options and cultural engagement opportunities.
  </p>
  <p>
    Blue Rim 5™ is structured for disciplined coastal exploration, not random bluewater wandering.
  </p>

  <h2>Fleet Risk Management</h2>
  <p>
    Formation spacing, communication protocols, weather-window discipline, and draft-aware routing form the backbone of the fleet’s operational strategy. Each vessel remains responsible for its own decisions, but reckless independence has no place in expedition sailing.
  </p>

  <h2>Expedition Discipline & Decision Making</h2>
  <p>
    The sea rewards preparation and punishes complacency. Expedition sailing requires restraint, timing, and humility. Small boats can accomplish extraordinary coastal journeys — when discipline and formation strength are applied correctly.
